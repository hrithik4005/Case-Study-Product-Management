#Business impact alignment

These case studies simulate real-world PM challenges and showcase my ability to:

Break down ambiguous problems

Design scalable product strategies

Align user value with business growth

Define measurable success frameworks

My Approach:

Porter’s 5 Forces,
Competitor benchmarking (Local Xerox, Blinkit, Printo),
10+ user interviews,
Security & trust mapping

Insight:
The real barrier is NOT convenience — it’s data privacy trust.
Strategic Recommendation,
Build the service around 4 pillars:

i. Speed (<30 mins delivery)

Business Thinking
Students = price-sensitive.

iii.Switch apps during recharge

iv.Choose faster flows (Google Pay)

v.Don’t trust reward systems

vi.Don’t build recharge habit

vii/Recharge is frequent but not habitual.

Core Problem

Recharge experience is:
Reactive,
Cognitively heavy,
Unpredictable,
Non-habit forming,

Users prioritize:Speed + Certainty over Brand Loyalty

Research Insights 

Key findings:

i.Plan selection = #1 friction (decision fatigue)

ii.30–35% drop at awareness stage (home screen clutter)

iii.15–20% drop at plan selection

iv.20–25% drop at payment stage (trust anxiety)

v.~50% churn before next recharge cycle

vi.Guaranteed cashback preferred over probabilistic rewards

Personas Identified:

i.Speed-first urban professional

ii.Value-seeking family manager

iii.Rural budget maximizer

iv.Each segment had different triggers but same need:

“Make recharge automatic and trustworthy.”

Solution Strategy:

Instead of optimizing UI alone, I built two self-reinforcing growth loops:

Loop 1: Universal Coins → Recharge Habit Loop

From page 16 & 21:

Bill Payment → Earn Coins → Recharge Discount → Savings → More Bill Payments

Key idea:

Convert cashback into usable recharge currency

Show real monetary value (not abstract points)

Restrict redemption to recharge → increase stickiness

Loop 2: UPI Lite Auto-Topup → Continuity Loop

Enable Auto-Topup → Stay Connected → More Usage → Auto-Recharge → Trust → Repeat

Core insight:

Users don’t want better recharge.
They want to never think about recharge.

Unit Economics Thinking:

i.5% coins issued on high-margin bill payments

ii.Coins redeemed only for recharge

iii.Commission earned on recharge = 2–3%

iv.Redemption capped → controlled liability

v.Coins = deferred cost + engagement driver

Flywheel:

Credit card spend → Coins → Recharge redemption → Commission → Retention → More spend

North Star Metric 

Unique users in last 30 days who:
Completed ≥1 Auto-Topup via UPI Lite
OR
Redeemed coins for recharge

Why this works:
Captures habit,
Captures monetization,
Captures retention,
Captures automation adoption
